## Project Challenge: CLI-Based Two-Player Vehicle Racing Game in PHP

**Project Brief**:  
Develop a CLI-based two-player racing game in PHP. The game begins with the players choosing a vehicle from a list provided in a `vehicles.json` file. Each vehicle has a maximum speed. The application will calculate the time taken by each vehicle to complete a given distance based on its speed, and then declare the winner.

**How To Play**:   
1. Go to the root of the project.
2. Run the `composer install` command to install the necessary package.
3. Run the `php Game.php` command to run the game.
